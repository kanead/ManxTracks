3_state_HMM
This is a 3 state model without any covariates and no subsets of data interpolated to 5 mins

3StateHMMSubset-Chloro
This is a 3 state model without any covariates but with the ID levels that have NAs for chlorophyll dropped and interpolated to 5 mins (should be compared to 3StateHMMSubset+Chloro)

3StateHMMSubset+Chloro
This is a 3 state model with monthly chlorophyll covariate and with the ID levels that have NAs for chlorophyll dropped and interpolated to 5 mins (should be compared to 3StateHMMSubset-Chloro)

3StateHMMSubset-ChloroBuffer
This is a 3 state model without any covariates but with the ID levels that have NAs for chlorophyll dropped and interpolated to 5 mins (should be compared to 3StateHMMSubset+ChloroBuffer). Points within a 5km radius of High Island have been removed.

3StateHMMSubset+ChloroBuffer
This is a 3 state model with monthly chlorophyll covariate and with the ID levels that have NAs for chlorophyll dropped and interpolated to 5 mins (should be compared to 3StateHMMSubset-ChloroBuffer). Points within a 5km radius of High Island have been removed.

3StateHMMSubset-ChloroBuffer-ExtremeChloro
This is a 3 state model without monthly chlorophyll covariate and with the ID levels that have NAs for chlorophyll dropped and interpolated to 5 mins (should be compared to 3StateHMMSubset+ChloroBuffer-ExtremeChloro). Points within a 5km radius of High Island have been removed. Rows with extreme chlorophyll values have been removed > 10

3StateHMMSubset+ChloroBuffer-ExtremeChloro
This is a 3 state model with monthly chlorophyll covariate and with the ID levels that have NAs for chlorophyll dropped and interpolated to 5 mins (should be compared to 3StateHMMSubset-ChloroBuffer-ExtremeChloro). Points within a 5km radius of High Island have been removed. Rows with extreme chlorophyll values have been removed > 10

3StateHMMSubset-ChloroBuffer-ExtremeChloro
This is a 3 state model without monthly chlorophyll covariate and with the ID levels that have NAs for chlorophyll dropped and interpolated to 5 mins (should be compared to 3StateHMMSubset+ChloroBuffer-ExtremeChloro). Points within a 5km radius of High Island have been removed. Rows with extreme chlorophyll values have been removed > 10

3StateHMMSubset+Chloro_Buffer_GB_HI
This is a 3 state model with monthly chlorophyll covariate and with the ID levels that have NAs for chlorophyll dropped and interpolated to 5 mins (should be compared to 3StateHMMSubset-Chloro_Buffer_GB_HI). Points within a 5km radius of High Island and GB have been removed. 

3StateHMMSubset-Chloro_Buffer_GB_HI
This is a 3 state model without monthly chlorophyll covariate and with the ID levels that have NAs for chlorophyll dropped and interpolated to 5 mins (should be compared to 3StateHMMSubset+Chloro_Buffer_GB_HI). Points within a 5km radius of High Island and GB have been removed. 

3StateHMMSubset+NullChloro_Buffer_GB_HI
This is a 3 state model with monthly chlorophyll covariate randomly rearranged and with the ID levels that have NAs for chlorophyll dropped and interpolated to 5 mins (should be compared to 3StateHMMSubset+Chloro_Buffer_GB_HI). Points within a 5km radius of High Island and GB have been removed.
