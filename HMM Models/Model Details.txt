3_state_HMM
This is a 3 state model without any covariates and no subsets of data interpolated to 5 mins

3StateHMMSubset-Chloro
This is a 3 state model without any covariates but with the ID levels that have NAs for chlorophyll dropped and interpolated to 5 mins (should be compared to 3StateHMMSubset+Chloro)

3StateHMMSubset+Chloro
This is a 3 state model with monthly chlorophyll covariate and with the ID levels that have NAs for chlorophyll dropped and interpolated to 5 mins (should be compared to 3StateHMMSubset-Chloro)

3StateHMMSubset-ChloroBuffer
This is a 3 state model without any covariates but with the ID levels that have NAs for chlorophyll dropped and interpolated to 5 mins (should be compared to 3StateHMMSubset+Chloro). Points within a 5km radius of High Island have been removed.
